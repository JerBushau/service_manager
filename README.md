Service manager application
---------------------------
This application was created to help track the progress of service calls until they are complete and filed into Quickbooks.

It does this by collecting all the necessary information from user input at the time of call and formatting that info into a neat table. It also allows the users to keep that information up to date as the situation progresses. Users can sort and search through the service calls as needed from any PC connected to the LAN.

To run the application:
  + install and/or start mongodb
  + git clone repo
  + run npm install
  + run npm start
  + check localhost:3000
