# Service manager application

### code Louisville FSJS Final Project
This application was created to help track the progress of service calls until they are complete and filed into Quickbooks. It functions well, but I plan to continue work on it adding several features.

## To run the application:
  + install and/or start mongodb
  + `git clone` repo
  + run `npm install`
  + run `npm start`
  + checkout `localhost:3000`

To edit entries simply click on any of the text you'd like to edit and you will see all available editing options.


## Setting up for development:
  + install and/or start mongodb
  + if you don't have sass installed, you can get it [here](http://sass-lang.com/install)
  + if you do not have nodemon run `npm install -g nodemon`
  + `git clone` repo
  + run `npm install`
  + run `npm run dev-mode`
  + checkout `localhost:3000`

Now you are ready for development! Using npm as a task-runner, `npm run dev-mode` will start the app with nodemon and complile the sass and webpack the angular app when any changes to those files are made. :tada:
