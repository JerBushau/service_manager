Service manager application
---------------------------
This application was created to help track the progress of service calls. 

It does this by collecting all the necessary information from user input at the time of call and formatting that info into a neat table. It also allows the user to keep that information up to date as the situation progresses. 

The user can sort and search through that info as needed from any PC connected to the LAN, this allows the user to rely less on pen and paper which cost money and can be lost / hard to read / constistantly format. 

To run the application:
  + clone repo
  + npm install
  + npm start
  + check localhost:3000
