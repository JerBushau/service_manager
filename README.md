Service manager application
---------------------------
Code Louisville FSJS Final Project

This application was created to help track the progress of service calls until they are complete and filed into Quickbooks.

To run the application:
  + install and/or start mongodb
  + `git clone` repo
  + run `npm install`
  + run `npm start`
  + checkout `localhost:3000`
Your good to go!

Setting up for development:
  + install and/or start mongodb
  + if you do not have nodemon run `npm install -g nodemon`
  + `git clone` repo
  + run `npm install`
  + run `npm run dev-mode`
  + checkout `localhost:3000`
Now you are ready for development, the sass files will be compiled on changes and the js within app/ directory will be webpacked on changes.
