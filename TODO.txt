TODO:

	Re-write entire application for practice/further understanding of angular.

	possibly implement "re-run" display to link related calls 
		just adding a re-run flag to the calls would allow me to sort by re-run and business name. That way all re-runs would display in order of busniess name to link related calls

	real time updates with socket.io (? possibly use some angular built-in to achieve similar behavior)
		this could potentially branch into a browser extention for the app.

  	(**done**)rewrite css using sass
  	refactor sass

	further refactor angular scripts
		need to create form controller so that form tasks are not cluttering the main ctrl?
			
	explore custom directives further and try to gain a better understanding of how ngTransclude works with $scope

	add route for employoees to veiw calls but not edit them.

	(**done**)research implementing sorting/searches the correct way (probably angular output)
		(**done**)use angulars ngRepeat with orderBy and/or filter to sort data

IMPORTANT ASPECTS: 
	
	call entry format. 
		Keeping all the information in one place, easy to access and update.

	sorting the data. 
		getting the information you want from the page as quickly and easily as possible.
		
		create a sorting/search controller to handle these actions and create an attractive menu from which to choose sort/search catagories.
